### "Sorcerer's Tide"  by Christopher Magiera
Welcome to my CS50X final project! I'm very proud to made it until here. I found out that it takes a lot of effort, in developing a game. A single person won't be able to create something thats marketable to create profits compared to games in the gaming-industries. That effort a single person has to put in, is years of work. Until the game is released then, things are not up-to-date anymore. But the efforts of a single developer will be enough to create cool Indie-Games that are FTP. When I started developing this game, I found myself in a new hobby that will not be finished with the final project. When I will send in this project, latest on the 31st of December 2022, it is an playable "alpha" that comes with the most functions and game mechanics.
I made colliders that the player could only take part in places of the map that are finished.

### About the game
In "Sorcerer's Tide" you take place in an open-world game. You play as a young fire wizard named "Merrjal" who was a member of a powerful sorcerers' order known as the Order of the glowing ashes."Merrjal" had always dreamed of using his magical abilities to protect the world and bring justice to those in need.
However, despite his best efforts,"Merrjal" struggled to control his powers and often caused unintentional destruction whenever he tried to use his magic. Frustrated with"Merrjal"'s inability to control his abilities, the Order of the glowing ashes ultimately decided to banish him from their ranks.
Feeling abandoned and alone,"Merrjal" wandered the land, searching for a way to prove himself and regain the trust of the Order.
One day,"Merrjal" received word of a demonic invasion that was threatening to overtake the kingdom. Determined to redeem himself,"Merrjal" set out to stop the demons and protect the people.
When he battled on,"Merrjal"'s control over his magical powers improved, and he was able to unleash devastating attacks on the demons, helping to turn the tide of the war.
It is your task to defeat the demons and let "Merrjal" emerge as a hero that he could return to the Order of the glowing ashes.

### Objective in the game
Your objective is to kill all enemies. You could approach this by casting fireballs in their direction. There are two enemy-types, the goblin and the imp. They got different abilites.
Don't get too close to the enemies, they will slice you. If you got sliced, look at the healthbar (hearts) on the left corner.
When you succeed, there will be a winning screen.
When you loose, there will be a loosing screen.
Have fun!
